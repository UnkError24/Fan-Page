        <p>NF is the stage name of rapper and composer Nate Feuerstein, whose raw emotions and honest lyrics launched him into the upper reaches of the charts with his 2017 album Perception. Initially emerging in 2010, NF gained wider attention after his 2015 album, Mansion, and 2016 follow-up, Therapy Session, both reached number one on the Christian charts. That success set the stage for his 2017 breakthrough. Buoyed by the Top 20 hit "Let You Down," Perception hit number one on the Billboard 200. NF's second Billboard 200 chart-topper, The Search, arrived in 2019 and was followed in 2021 by the mixtape Clouds.</p>
